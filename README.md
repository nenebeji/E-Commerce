## Project Description

This is an Express.Js back end application that for an E-commerce site.

* When a user adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file they are connected to a database using Sequelize.

* When the user enters schema and seeds commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

* When they enter the command to invoke the application their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

* When they open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

* Users can test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
